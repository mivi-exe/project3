                    <h2>THE MENU</h2>
                    <p>"The Menu" is a horror thriller movie that focuses on a highly rated restaurant that's gone rogue for the evenings' guests. Unbeknownst to them, they are the stars in this culinary cult's demonstration. Head Chef Slowik intends to mock all of his diners through his tasting menu as well as punish them for their hubris. No one appreciates real food anymore and they'll die for their sins. Well, there is one exception, and she isn't supposed to be there. Margot acts as the wrench in Slowik's machine as she forces him to realize that even he has lost the joy of cooking, and she just wants a damn good cheeseburger.</p>

                    <p id="thold">Tips</p>
                    <p id="tip1">Any high fat food can "split" if heated too quickly. This is why reheated Mac n Cheese or creamy pasta is sometimes an oil slick. Try baking at lower heat or microwaving at low power for a longer time to prevent splitting your food.</p>

                   <p id="tip2">As good as they are, crinkle cut fries are fairly unpopular and usually don't get ranked highly if you ask someone what their favorite kind of fry is. The most popular types are usually steak, curly, waffle, and garlic.</p>

                    <p id="tip3">A mandolin can accurately slice thin cut vegetables quickly, but it is extremely sharp and dangerous so use a guard. I'm not saying this from personal experience at all. I did not slice the tip of my thumb off. Nope.</p>

                    <p id="tip4">To achieve extra crisp fries, opt of a high starch potato such as russet or yukon. Frying your fries at a low temperature then again at a heigh temperature will yield that signature fast food crunchy exterior, and fluffy interior.</p>

                    <p id="tip5">Seasoning from a greater height will result in a wide, even distribution of the seasoning. Be careful not to overwork the ground beef, mushing and mashing too much will make the texture springy and unpleasant.</p>

                    <p id="tip6">For the best tasting patty, grind up your own mix of burger meat. Popular blends include brisket, chuck, short rib, sirloin, and some fat. Most blends also aim for a 15% - 20% fat content to ensure a juicy burger.</p>

                    <p id="tip7">Smashed or smeared burgers have been around for awhile, but Smashburger popularized them throughout the 2000s and into the modern era. They're coveted for their crispy sear and are often stacked at least 2 patties high.</p>
                
                    <p id="tip8">While this burger is plain, there are many amazing popular and unpopular toppings! I recommend garlic aioli, a fried egg, coleslaw, kimchi, caramelized onions, arugula, and extra thick cut bacon. </p>

                        <li id="p3">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Form two 4oz patties from burger meat. Set your cast iron skillet to low heat. Once heated apply oil to skillet and toast your burger buns. Set aside.</li>
